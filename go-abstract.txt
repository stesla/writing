Gospecify is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for Go.
Rather than focus on testing every nook and cranny of some code, it
helps a programmer produce an executable specification of that code's
behavior. Go's syntax allowed gospecify to be almost as expressive
as Ruby's rpsec; however, a few tricks had to be used to achieve the
best readability. This talk will introduce BDD concepts and
demonstrate how to implement them in Go using gospecify.
