On my first Go project, I used gotest. After a while, I found that I
really did miss the features of frameworks in other languages. So, I
wrote one. Gospecify is a behavior-driven development (BDD)
framework. Rather than focus on testing every nook and cranny of some
code, it helps a programmer produce an executable specification of
that code's behavior. The language's syntax allowed for gospecify to
be almost as expressive as Ruby's rpsec; however, a few tricks had to
be used to achieve the best readability.
