<p>Google recently announced their new programming language, Go.</p>

<!-- More introduction here -->

<h2>What is Go?</h2>
** Experimental
** Simple, fast, safe, concurrent
** Designed to solve the kinds of problems Google faces
** Essentially C 2.0

<h2>Reading Go</h2>

<p>Go's syntax continues in the same vein as C's. Programs are
organized as functions whose bodies are a sequence of
statements. Blocks of code are surrounded by curly-braces. The
language has a limited set of reserved keywords. Expressions use the
same infix operators. There are very few syntactical surprises.</p>

<p>The Go authors have adhered to a single guiding principle when
designing the language: simplicity and clarity above all else. Several
of the new syntactical constructs provide concise means to express
common idioms that are more verbose in C. Others address language
choices that, after several decades of use, have been shown to be
unwise.</p>

<h3>Variable Declarations</h3>

<p>Variables are declared as follows:</p>

<pre>var sum int // Just a declaration
var total int = 42 // A declaration with initialization</pre>

<p>Most notably, the type in these declarations comes <em>after</em>
the variable name. This may seem strange at first, but has some
benefits on clarity. For example, take the following snippet of C:</p>

<pre>int* a, b;</pre>

<p>It is not apparent, but that actually means that <code>a</code> is
a pointer and <code>b</code> is not. In order to declare them both
pointers, the asterisk must be repeated. However in Go, they can both
be declared pointers as follows:</p>

<pre>var a, b *int</pre>

<p>If a variable is being initialized, the compiler can typically
infer its type, so it is not necessary for the programmer to type it
out:</p>

<pre>var label = "name"</pre>

<p>However, at that point, the <code>var</code> keyword is almost
superfluous. So, the Go authors introduced a new assignment operator
which both declares and initializes a new variable:</p>

<pre>name := "Samuel"</pre>

<h3>Conditionals</h3>

<p>Conditionals in Go have the familiar if-else construction as those
in C, but the condition need not be wrapped in parentheses. This
creates less visual clutter when reading code.</p>

<p>Parentheses are not the only clutter that have been removed. A
simple statement can be included before the condition so that the
following code:</p>

<pre>result := someFunc();
if result > 0 {
	/* Do something */
} else {
	/* Handle error */
}</pre>

<p>Can be reduced to this:</p>

<pre>if result := someFunc(); result > 0 { 
	/* Do something */
} else {
	/* Handle error */
}</pre>

<p>However, in the latter example, <code>result</code> is only in
scope inside the conditional block. Whereas before it had to be in the
containing scope.</p>

<h3>Switches</h3>

<p>Switches once again are similar, but improved. Like conditionals,
they allow a simple statement to proceed the expression that is being
switched upon. However, they deviate even further from their C
counterparts.

<p>First, to make switches more concise, two changes were made. Cases
can be comma-separated lists of values, and fallthrough is no longer
the default behavior.</p>

<p>So, the following C code:</p>

<pre>int result;
switch (byte) {
 case 'a':
 case 'b':
   {
     result = 1
     break
   }

 default:
   result = 0
}</pre>

<p>Becomes this in Go:</p>

<pre>var result int
switch byte {
case 'a', 'b':
  result = 1
default:
  result = 2
}</pre>

<p>Second, Go switches can match on much more than integers and
characters. Any valid expression can be the value of a case statement,
so long as it is the same type as the switch expression.</p>

<p>So, the following C code:</p>

<pre>int result = calculate();
if (result &lt; 0) {
  /* negative */
} else if (result &gt; 0) {
  /* positive */
} else {
  /* zero */
}</pre>

<p>Becomes this in Go:</p>

<pre>switch result := calculate(); true {
case result &lt; 0:
  /* negative */
case result &gt; 0:
  /* positive */
default:
  /* zero */
}</pre>

<p>That idiom is so common, that if the switch value is omitted, it is
assumed to be true. So the above could be rewritten as:</p>

<pre>switch result := calculate(); {
case result &lt; 0:
  /* negative */
case result &gt; 0:
  /* positive */
default:
  /* zero */
}</pre>


<h3>Loops</h>

Go has only one keyword to introduce a loop. However, it offers all of
the looping behaviours available in C except the do-while.

<h4>Condition</h4>

<pre>for a > b { /* ... */ }</pre>

<h4>Initializer, Condition and Step</h4>

<pre>for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { /* ... */ }</pre>

<h4>Range</h4>

The right-hand expression of a range clause must be an array, slice,
string or map, or a pointer to an array; or it may be a channel.

<pre>for i := range "hello" { /* ... */ }</pre>

<h4>Infinite</h4>

<pre>for { /* ever */ }</pre>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>The syntax for declaring functions differs from C. As with variable
declarations, types are declared after the terms they describe. So the
following function in C:</p>

<pre>int add(int a, b) { return a + b }</pre>

<p>Becomes this function in Go:</p>

<pre>func add(a, b int) int { return a + b }</pre>

<h4>Multiple Return Values</h4>

<p>A common idiom in C is to either reserve a return value to indicate
error (e.g. <code>read()</code> returning 0), or to reserve the return
value to communicate status and pass in a pointer to a memory location
in which to store results. This encourages unsafe programming
practices and is not viable in a managed language such as Go.</p>

<p>Recognizing that this problem extends beyond the simple need to
communicate both function results and errors, the Go authors built in
the capability to return multiple values from a function.</p>

<p>As an example, a function to return both parts of an integer division:</p>

<pre>func divide(a, b int) (int, int) {
  quotient := a / b
  remainder := a % b
  return quotient, remainder
}</pre>

<p>Recognizing that with multiple return values, it is good to have
the code document which is which, you can give the return values names
just like parameters. You can then assign values to those return
variables just like any other. So we could rewrite <code>divide</code>
like this:

<pre>func divide(a, b int) (quotient, remainder int) {
  quotient = a / b
  remainder = a % b
  return
}</pre>

<p>The presence of multiple-return values has given rise to the
comma-ok pattern. Functions which can fail can return a second,
boolean, result to indicate success. Alternatively, they can return an
error object. So it's not uncommon to see code like this:</p>

<pre>if result, ok := moreMagic(); ok {
  /* Do something with result */
}</pre>

<h4>Anonymous Functions</h4>

<p>Having a garbage collector opens the door for a wide variety of
features. Among those are anonymous functions. Go provides a simple
syntax for declaring anonymous functions. These functions create a
lexical closure on the scope in which they were defined like blocks in
many dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Consider the following program:</p>

<pre>func makeAdder(x int) (func(int) int) {
  return func(y int) int { return x + y }
}

func main() {
  add5 := makeAdder(5);
  add36 := makeAdder(36);
  fmt.Println("The answer:", add5(add36(1))); //=> The answer: 42
}</pre>

<h3>Primitive Types</h3>

<p>Like C, Go offers a handful of primitive types. The usual boolean,
integer and floating-point types are available. It has a unicode
string type and an array type. The language also introduces two new
types: slice and map.</p>

<h4>Arrays & Slices</h4>

<p>Arrays in Go are not dynamic like they are in C. Their size is part
of their type, and is determined at compile time. To index into an
array the familiar C syntax is used (e.g. <code>a[i]</code>). The
compiler provides a built-in function, which is evaluated at compile
time, to determine the length of an array
(e.g. <code>len(a)</code>). If a write to an index beyond the bounds
of an array is attempted, a run-time error will be generated.</p>

<p>Go also offers slices, which put a new twist on arrays. A slice
represents a contiguous segment of an array. However, it need not
represent the entire array, and can grow up to that limit. Once again,
the length of a slice can be determined at compile-time. The capacity
of a slice (retrievable by <code>cap(s)</code>, where <code>s</code>
is a slice) determines how much room the slice has to grow. To
construct a slice from an array (or another slice) the syntax
<code>a[lo:hi]</code> is used, where <code>lo</code> is a zero-based
index and <code>hi</code> is a one-based index. If a slice that goes
to the end of the array is desired, <code>hi</code> may be
omitted.</p>

<p>The following code illustrates how arrays and slices work:</p>

<pre>a := [...]int{1,2,3,4,5} // The ... means "whatever length the initializer has"
len(a) //=> 5

/* Slice from the middle */
s := a[2:4] //=> [3 4]
len(s), cap(s) //=> 2, 3

/* Grow the slice */
s = s[0:3] //=> [3 4 5]
len(s), cap(s) //=> 3, 3

/* Slice all the way to the end */
t := a[3:] //=> [4 5]

/* They all share the same array */
a[4] = 6
a[4] == s[2] == t[1] == 6 //=> true
</pre>
 
<h4>Maps</h4>

<p>One data type that is present in most every dynamic language that
is popular to day, but that is missing from C, is a dictionary. Go
offers a primitive dictionary type called a map. The following example
shows how to make and use a Go map.</p>

<pre>m := make(map[string] int); // A mapping of strings to ints

/* Store some values */
m["foo"] = 42
m["bar"] = 30

/* Read, and cause runtime-error if key is not present. */
x := m["foo"];

/* Read, with comma-ok check; ok will be false if key was not present. */
x, ok := m["bar"]

/* Check for presence of key, _ means "I don't care about this value." */
_, ok := m["baz"] // ok == false

/* Delete a key */
m["bar"] = nil, false</pre>

<h2>Object Orientation</h2>

<p>The Go language supports a style of object-oriented programming
similar to that used in C. Data is grouped together into structs, and
then functions are defined which operate on those structs. Similar to
Python, the language offers a way to define the functions and then
call them so that the syntax is not cumbersome.</p>

<h3>Structs</h3>

<p>Declaring a new struct type is simple:</p>

<pre>type Point struct {
  x, y float64
}</pre>

<p>Values of this type can now be allocated using the built-in
function <code>new</code>, which returns a pointer to the value in
memory with all slots initialized to the zero value.</p>

<pre>var p *Point = new(Point)
p.x = 3
p.y = 4</pre>

<p>That can get verbose, and one of the goals of the Go language is to
be concise whenever possible. So a syntax is provided that both
allocates and initializes the struct at the same time:</p>

<pre>var p1 Point = Point{3,4}  // Value
var p2 *Point = &amp;Point{3,4} // Pointer</pre>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Once a type has been declared, functions can be declared which take
that type as an implicit first parameter:</p>

<pre>func (self Point) Length() float {
  return math.Sqrt(self.x*self.x + self.y*self.y);
}</pre>

<p>Those functions can then be called as methods on the struct:</p>

<pre>p := Point{3,4}
d := p.Length() //=> 5</pre>

<p>Methods can actually be declared on both value and pointer
types. Go will handle referencing or dereferencing objects as
appropriate, so it is possible to declare methods on both type
<code>T</code> and type <code>*T</code> and have them be used as
appropriate.</p>

<p>Let us extend our <code>Point</code> class with a mutator:</p>

<pre>
/* Note the receiver is *Point */
func (self *Point) Scale(factor float64) {
  self.x = self.x * factor
  self.y = self.y * factor
}<pre>

<p>Then we can call it like this:</p>

<pre>p.Scale(2);
d = p.Length() //=> 10</pre>

<p>It is important to understand that the <code>self</code> that is
passed in to <code>MoveToXY</code> is a parameter like any other, and
parameters are passed-by-value. That is why it must be declared as a
pointer type in order to actually change the value. If it were
declared as just <code>Point</code>, then the struct that was modified
inside the method would not be the same one at the call site.</p>

<h3>Interfaces</h3>

<p>Dynamic languages such as Ruby emphasize a style of object-oriented
programming that places more importance on what behavior an object has
rather than what type that object is. One of the most powerful
features that Go brings with it is the ability to program with that
duck-typed mentality, and check for adherence to those defined
behaviors at compile time. The name given to the behaviors is
<em>interfaces</em>.</p>

<p>Defining an interface is simple:</p>

<pre>type Writer interface {
  Write(p []byte) (n int, err os.Error)
}</pre>

<p>That defines an interface with a method for writing a buffer of
bytes. Any object which implements that method also implements the
interface. No declarations are required as in Java, the compiler just
figures it out. This gives the expressiveness of duck-typing with the
safety of static type-checking.</p>

<p>The way interfaces behave in Go allows develoeprs to discover their
programs' types as they write them. If there are several objects that
all have the behavior, and a programmer wishes to abstract on that
behavior, she can create an interface and then use that.</p>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre>// Somewhere in some code:
type Widget struct {}
func (Widget) Frob() { /* do something */ }

// Somewhere else in the code:
type Sprocket struct {}
func (Sprocket) Frob() { /* do something else */ }

/* New code, and we want to take both Widgets and Sprockets and Frob them */
type Frobber interface {
  Frob()
}

func frobtastic(f Frobber) { f.Frob() }</pre>

<p>It is important to note that every object implements the empty interface:</p>

<pre>interface {}</pre>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>The Go language does not have inheritance, at least not the way
most languages do. There is no hierarchy of types. Go encourages the
use of composition and delegation over inheritance, and offers some
syntax sugar to make it more bearable.</p>

<p>Given these definitions:</p>

<pre>type Engine interface {
  Start()
  Stop()
}

type Car struct {
  Engine
}</pre>

<p>I can then write the following:</p>

<pre>func GoToWorkIn(c Car) {
  /* get in car */

  c.Start();

  /* drive to work */

  c.Stop();

  /* get out of car */
}</pre>

<p>When I declared the <code>Car</code> struct, I gave it what is
called an <em>anonymous member</em>. That is a member which is
identified only by its type. The anonymous member is a member like any
other, with a name the same as the type. So I could have also written
<code>c.Engine.Start()</code>. The compiler automatically delegates
calls made on <code>Car</code> to methods on its <code>Engine</code>
if the <code>Car</code> does not have methods of its own to satisfy
them.</p>

<p>It is important to note, though, that this is syntax sugar on top
of <em>delegation</em> not inheritence. Once the anonymous member's
method has been called, flow has been delegated to that method
entirely. So you cannot simulate type hierarchy like this:</p>

<pre>type Base struct {}
func (Base) Magic() { fmt.Print("base magic") }
func (self Base) MoreMagic() { 
  self.Magic()
  self.Magic()
}

type Foo struct {
  Base
}
func (Foo) Magic() { fmt.Print("foo magic") }</pre>

<p>When you create a <code>Foo</code> object, it will respond to both
methods that <code>Base</code> does. However, when you call
<code>MoreMagic</code> you will not get the results you expect:</p>

<pre>f := new(Foo)
f.Magic() //=> foo magic
f.MoreMagic() //=> base magic base magic</pre>

<h2>Concurrency</h2>

<p>The Go authors chose a message-passing model as their recommended
method for concurrent programming. The language does still support
shared memory, however the authors have the following philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share
memory by communicating.</blockquote>

<p>The language offers two basic constructs to achieve this paradigm:
goroutines and channels.</p>

<h3>Goroutines</h3>

<p>Goroutines are lightweight parallel paths of program execution similar
to threads, coroutines, or processes. However, they are sufficiently
different from each that the Go authors elected to give them a new
name and discard any connotative baggage that the other terms might
have.</p>

<p>Spawning a goroutine to run a function named <code>DoThis</code> is
as simple as this:</p>

<pre>go DoThis() // but do not wait for it to complete</pre>

<p>Anonymous functions can also be used:</p>

<pre>go func() {
  for { /* do something forever */ }
}() // Note that the function must be invoked</pre>

<p>These goroutines are mapped to the appropriate operating-system
concurrency primitives (e.g. POSIX threads) by the Go runtime.</p>

<h3>Channels</h3>

<p>With goroutines, parallel execution of code is easy. However, a
mechanism for communicating between them is still needed. Channels
provide a FIFO communication queue that can be used for just this
purpose.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax for working with channels:</p>

<pre>/* Creating a channel uses make, not new */
ch := make(chan int)

/* Sending a value blocks until the value is read */
ch <- 4

/* Reading a value blocks until a value is available */
i := <-ch</pre>

<p>For example, if we wanted to do some long-running numerical
computation we could do this:</p>

<pre>ch := make(chan int)

go func() {
  result := 0
  for i := 0; i < 100000000; i++ {
    result = result + i
  }
  ch <- result
}()

/* Do something for a while */

sum := <-ch // This will block if the calculation is not done yet
fmt.Println("The sum is:", sum)</pre>

<p>The blocking behavior of channels is not always the best. The
language offers two ways to customize this. A programmer can specify a
buffer size. Sends to a buffered channel will not block unless
the buffer is full, and reads from a buffered channel will not block
unless the buffer is empty. The language also offers the ability to
send and receive without ever blocking, while still reporting if the
operation succeeded.</p>

<pre>/* Create a channel with buffer size 5 */
ch := make(chan int, 5)

/* Send without blocking, ok will be true if value was buffered */
ok := ch <- 42

/* Read without blocking, ok will be true if a value was read */
val, ok := <-ch</pre>

<h2>Packages</h2>

<p>Go offers a simple mechanism for organizing code: packages. Each
file begins with a simple declaration of what package it belongs
to. Each file can import the packages it uses. Names are exported
from a package simply by virtue of beginning with a capital
letter.</p>

<p>Here is a complete source file:</p>

<pre>package geometry

import "math"

/* Point is capitalized, so it is visible outside the package. */

type Point struct {

  /* the fields are not capitalized, so they are not visible
     outside of the package */

  x, y float64 
}

/* These functions are visible outside of the package */

func (self Point) Length() float64 {
  /* This uses a function in the math package */
  return math.Sqrt(self.x*self.x + self.y*self.y)
}

func (self *Point) Scale(factor float64) {
  self.setX(self.x * factor)
  self.setY(self.y * factor)
}

/* These functions are not visible outside of the package, but can be
   used inside the package */

func (self *Point) setX(x float64) { self.x = x }
func (self *Point) setY(y float64) { self.y = y }</pre>

<h2>What's Missing

<p>The Go authors have tried to let clarity of code guide all of their
decisions regarding the design of the language. A secondary mission
has been to produce a language which compiles quickly. With these two
criteria to steer them, many features from other languages have not
made it in. Many programmers will find that their favorite language
feature is not present. Indeed, some feel that the language is
unsuable for lack of certain features common in other languages.</p>

<p>Two such featues are exceptions and generics. Neither are currently
part of the Go language...yet. The language is still very young, and
it is still highly experimental. However, it is important not to
compare Go to languages such as Java, as it was not meant to compete
in that arena. When looking at Go, compare it to C.</p>

<p>Since the language is young, it does not have much in the way of
libraries or tools. There are no IDEs for Go. There is a standard
library with some useful code, but it is very small compared to what
is availble in more mature languages.</p>
