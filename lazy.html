I was recently linked to an insightful article about how <a
href="http://www.gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard.html">software
is hard</a>. He makes several good points, but the one that sticks out
most in my mind is the following:</p>

<blockquote>Every software engineer has a low opinion of the way we
develop software.  Even the term "software engineering," Rosenberg
writes, is a statement of hope, not fact.  He quotes the 1968 NATO <a
href="http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/index.html">Software
Engineering Conference</a> that coined the term: "We undoubtedly
produce software by backward techniques."  "We build systems like the
Wright brothers built airplanes--build the whole thing, push it off
the cliff, let it crash, and start over again."  Certainly statements
that could still be made forty years later.</blockquote>

That is so true, especially when it comes to the programming languages
we use. Most of the languages with widespread use in industry today
are essentially thirty years old, and even those are just the latest
in a long <a href="http://www.levenez.com/lang/">lineage</a> that
leads back to Fortran and Lisp in the late sixties. Languages in
today's generation don't do anything for you that their ancestors
didn't forty years ago.
