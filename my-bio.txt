Samuel Tesla has had a computer at his fingertips his entire life. He
started coding at age six as a maintenance programmer: tweaking a
BASIC program his father wrote. Since then, he has always had a
passion for telling computers what to do, and especially for
programming languages. From niche languages like LaTeX and Inform to
general purpose languages like C and Perl; static languages like
OCaml and Java to dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Lisp; he loves
to learn different ways to program. Currently he works for Engine Yard
slinging Ruby at the cloud. In his spare time he likes to code, play
guitar, and write fiction.
